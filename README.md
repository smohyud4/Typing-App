# KeyType
[KeyType](https://key-type-delta.vercel.app) is an individual typing test web application inspired by Nitro Type. After each race, your speed (WPM) and acceleration (WPM/S) are displayed through Recharts. In addition to saving standard typing metrics such as overall accuracy and WPM, users can observe their accuracies for every key they type through a visual graph similar to GitHub's contribution graph

## Features
- User authentication through JWT
- Static text generation for guest typing prompts
- Dynamic text generation for signed-in user's typing prompts
- Stat display after each typing race with various typing metrics including speed, acceleration, accuracy, characters typed, and mistakes
- Accuracy graph for every key
- Practice mode that allows signed-in users to practice any 2 different keys

## Technologies
PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node)
